#SumUp REST API

#SumUpâ€™s REST API operates with [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) HTTP requests and responses. The request bodies are sent through resource-oriented URLs and use the standard [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).  You can experiment and work on your integration in a sandbox that doesn't affect your regular data and doesn't process real transactions. To create a sandbox merchant account visit the [dashboard](https://me.sumup.com/settings/developer). To use the sandbox when interacting with SumUp APIs [create an API](https://me.sumup.com/settings/api-keys) key and use it for [authentication](https://developer.sumup.com/api/authentication).
