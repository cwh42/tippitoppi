#SumUp REST API

#SumUpâ€™s REST API operates with [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) HTTP requests and responses. The request bodies are sent through resource-oriented URLs and use the standard [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).  You can experiment and work on your integration in a sandbox that doesn't affect your regular data and doesn't process real transactions. To create a sandbox merchant account visit the [dashboard](https://me.sumup.com/settings/developer). To use the sandbox when interacting with SumUp APIs [create an API](https://me.sumup.com/settings/api-keys) key and use it for [authentication](https://developer.sumup.com/api/authentication).

  # unit tests for create_reader_checkout
  # Create a Reader Checkout
  # Create a Checkout for a Reader.  This process is asynchronous and the actual transaction may take some time to be stared on the device.   There are some caveats when using this endpoint: * The target device must be online, otherwise checkout won&#39;t be accepted * After the checkout is accepted, the system has 60 seconds to start the payment on the target device. During this time, any other checkout for the same device will be rejected.  **Note**: If the target device is a Solo, it must be in version 3.3.24.3 or higher.

  # unit tests for create_reader_terminate
  # Create a Reader Terminate action
  # Create a Terminate action for a Reader.  It stops the current transaction on the target device.  This process is asynchronous and the actual termination may take some time to be performed on the device.   There are some caveats when using this endpoint: * The target device must be online, otherwise terminate won&#39;t be accepted * The action will succeed only if the device is waiting for cardholder action: e.g: waiting for card, waiting for PIN, etc. * There is no confirmation of the termination.  If a transaction is successfully terminated and &#x60;return_url&#x60; was provided on Checkout, the transaction status will be sent as &#x60;failed&#x60; to the provided URL.  **Note**: If the target device is a Solo, it must be in version 3.3.28.0 or higher.
